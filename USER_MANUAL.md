## 1. The Multi-Agent Architecture
DigitalMEng operates on a **Commander-Worker** hierarchy. You do not manage tasks; you manage agents who execute tasks.

### Central Commander (Nandu)
Nandu is the "Brain" of DigitalMEng. He parses your natural language intent and dispatches instructions to the workers. 
- **Role:** Orchestration, Navigation, Diagnostic Reporting.
- **Capabilities:** Autonomous tab-switching, multi-step reasoning visualization.

### The Worker Fleet
- **Social Worker:** Expert in brevity and virality. Handles LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram generation.
- **SEO Worker:** Handles the "Semantic Layer." Optimizes blogs for Google's E-E-A-T guidelines and maps long-tail keywords.
- **Video Worker:** Specializes in high-velocity conversion. Scans long-form video, extracts "high-sentiment" clips, and applies AI subtitles.
- **Strategy Worker:** Monitors global trends (X Trends, Google Trends) and suggests real-time course corrections.

---

## 2. Central Command: Agent Nandu
Nandu is your interface to the machine. He is accessible via the **Sparkle Icon** (bottom-right).

### Interactive Commands
You can speak to Nandu in plain English. Examples of high-level orchestration:
- **Navigation:** *"Show me the analytics for last week,"* or *"I need to change my API keys."*
- **Strategy:** *"How should I get more Instagram followers this month?"*
- **Execution:** *"Generate 10 LinkedIn posts about AI ethics."*

### Agent Process Visualization (The Thought Log)
When you submit a command, Nandu displays his internal "checklists." 
- **Deconstructing Semantic Intent:** Translating your words into machine instructions.
- **Consulting Knowledge Base:** Accessing your Brand Profile and historical data.
- **Mapping System Capabilities:** Identifying which Worker Agent is best suited for the task.

### System Trace (The Kernel View)
For power users who want to see under the hood, Nandu offers a **System Trace** panel during complex operations.
- **Real-time Logs:** View raw terminal output from sub-agents (e.g., `[WORKER:VIDEO] Sub-agent "Clipper" online.`).
- **Transparency:** See exactly how engagement probability is calculated or how content distribution is mapped.
- **Access:** Click **"View Trace"** on any agent message that contains a complex execution plan.

### Action Protocols
When you click a button in Nandu's chat (e.g., "Open Settings"), he doesn't just navigate; he initiates a **Protocol Handshake** with the system kernel, ensuring all workers are synchronized before moving you to the new view.

---

## 3. The Onboarding Kernel: Synchronization
To make the agents effective, you must provide them with "Brand DNA."

### Brand Profile (`Settings > Brand Profile`)
- **Basic Info:** Your brand name and industry.
- **Voice & Tone:** Choose between "Professional," "Whimsical," "Bold," etc. This affects the vocabulary used by all Content Workers.
- **Target Audience:** Define your "Inner Circle." The agents use this to simulate how your audience will react to content before it's posted.

### API Credentials (`Settings > API Credentials`)
The "Limbs" of the app. Without these, the agents can think but cannot act.
- **LinkedIn/X/Meta APIs:** Required for autonomous posting.
- **Safety Mode:** DigitalMEng uses a "Human-in-the-loop" approval pipeline by default. You can disable this in Autopilot settings for 100% autonomy.

---

## 4. Content Studio: Production Workers
Located in the `Content` tab, this is where the agents "print" value.

### Batch Generation
Don't write one post at a time. Click **"Batch Generate"** to:
1. Input a single "Seed Idea" (e.g., "The future of remote work").
2. Let the agents generate 30+ posts across all platforms.
3. Review the **SEO Score** for each post before approving.

### Content Splintering (The Wizard)
Turn one piece of content into a multi-platform campaign:
- **Input:** A Blog URL or Video Link.
- **Output:** 5 Tweets, 2 LinkedIn posts, 1 Instagram Reel script, and 1 Email Newsletter.

### Visual & Video Workers
- **AI Video:** Generate short-form video clips with AI-generated voiceovers and auto-subtitles.
- **AI Images:** Integrated DALL-E/Stable Diffusion worker for custom social assets that match your brand palette.

---

## 5. The Analytics Intelligence Suite
Located in the `Analytics` tab. We go beyond "Vanity Metrics."

### Sentiment Mapping
Our agents don't just count likes; they read comments and map the **emotional response** of your audience (Positive, Negative, Curious, Sarcastic).

### A/B Testing Panel
The agents can run "Dark Tests" (internal simulations) on two different headlines. They will recommend the one with the highest **Predicted Reach** before you ever hit publish.

### Competitor Intelligence
The **Strategy Worker** constantly scans 3-5 of your top competitors. He will alert you if they are gaining traction on a specific topic so you can counter with your own content.

---

## 6. Autopilot Protocol (Engine Mode)
The "Set and Forget" marketing system.

### The 4-Step Initialization
1. **Trend Analysis:** Agents scan the market for trending "high-conversion" topics.
2. **Roadmap Builder:** A 90-day content calendar is drafted based on trending topics.
3. **Drafting Phase:** Workers generate all 90 days of content in a "Staging Area."
4. **Autonomous Deployment:** Once approved, the agents publish content at **Smart Slots** (hours when your specific audience is most likely to be online).

### Management
You can pause Autopilot at any time from the `Automation` tab. You can also "Intervene" on specific posts without stopping the global engine.

---

## 7. Enterprise Settings & Scaling
For agencies managing multiple brands.

### Team Members
Invite collaborators with specific roles:
- **Admin:** Full system control.
- **Editor:** Can approve/reject agent drafts but cannot change API keys.
- **Viewer:** Analytics only.

### Billing & Permissions
- **Free Tier:** 5 agentic generations per month, basic analytics.
- **Premium Tier:** Unlimited Nandu access, Autopilot enabled, Video clipping active.
- **Enterprise:** Dedicated worker bandwidth, custom API integrations, White-labeling.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting & Protocol Logs

### Troubleshooting
- **Build Errors:** If the UI becomes unresponsive, check for syntax errors in your custom CSS/JS injectors. 
- **API Disconnects:** Nandu will alert you if a token expires. Head to Settings to re-sync.
- **Worker Lag:** In high-traffic periods, rendering 4K video clips may take 2-3 minutes.

### System Diagnostics
Speak to Nandu: *"Full system check."* 
He will run a diagnostic loop:
- Checking API Latency...
- Verifying Auth state...
- Scanning Worker status...
- Protocol Health: **GREEN**
