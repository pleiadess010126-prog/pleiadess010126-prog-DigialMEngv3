## 6. Understanding GEO Scores

### 6.1 What is GEO?

**GEO = Generative Engine Optimization**

GEO helps your content get cited by AI assistants like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google's AI Overview.

```
Traditional SEO → Found in Google Search
GEO → Cited by AI Assistants

Why It Matters:
├── AI assistants are becoming primary search tools
├── Being cited = free recommendations
├── High GEO content gets more AI visibility
└── Future-proofs your content strategy
```

### 6.2 The 8 GEO Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Directness** | Clear, upfront answers | 75+ |
| **Authority** | Citations & expertise | 70+ |
| **Structure** | Headers, lists, tables | 80+ |
| **Conversational** | Natural, engaging tone | 70+ |
| **Freshness** | Current, timely content | 75+ |
| **Snippet Opt** | Featured snippet ready | 70+ |
| **Semantic** | Topic depth & entities | 70+ |
| **Readability** | Easy to understand | 80+ |

### 6.3 Reading Your GEO Score

```
GEO Score Breakdown Example:

Overall Score: 78 (Grade: B)
├── Directness:     82 ████████░░ Great!
├── Authority:      65 ██████░░░░ Needs work
├── Structure:      85 ████████░░ Excellent
├── Conversational: 74 ███████░░░ Good
├── Freshness:      80 ████████░░ Great!
├── Snippet Opt:    72 ███████░░░ Good
├── Semantic:       78 ███████░░░ Good
└── Readability:    88 ████████░░ Excellent

Recommendations:
→ Add 2-3 statistics with sources (Authority)
→ Include expert quotes (Authority)
```

### 6.4 Improving Low Scores

```
Low Directness (< 70):
→ Start with a clear answer in the first paragraph

→ Include statistics with sources
→ Quote industry experts

Low Structure (< 70):
→ Add more headings (H2, H3)
→ Use bullet points for key info
→ Add a table if comparing things

Low Conversational (< 70):
→ Use "you" and "your" more
→ Ask rhetorical questions
→ Write like you're explaining to a friend

Low Freshness (< 70):

→ Reference recent events/data
→ Update outdated statistics

Low Snippet Opt (< 70):
