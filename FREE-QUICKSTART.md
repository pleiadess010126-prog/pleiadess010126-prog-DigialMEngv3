## 5. Understanding Your Limits

### Monthly Content Budget

```
Free Plan: 10 pieces/month

Smart Allocation:
├── Week 1: 2-3 pieces (test different types)
├── Week 2: 2-3 pieces (refine approach)
├── Week 3: 2-3 pieces (optimize)
└── Week 4: 1-2 pieces (quality focus)

Tip: Save some for experiments!
```

### Content Counter

```
Dashboard > Top right shows: "3/10 used this month"

When you hit 10:
├── Wait until next month resets
├── Or upgrade to Starter (100/month)
```

### What Counts as 1 Piece?

```
Each generation = 1 piece, regardless of:
├── Content type (blog, short, reel)
├── Length (short or long)
└── Whether you publish it or not

Failed generations don't count ✓
Editing doesn't count ✓
Publishing doesn't count ✓
```

---

## 6. GEO Basics

### What is GEO?

```
GEO = Generative Engine Optimization

Traditional SEO → Rank on Google
GEO → Get cited by AI assistants (ChatGPT, etc.)

Why it matters:
├── AI assistants are growing fast
├── They recommend content they trust
├── GEO-optimized content gets cited
└── = Free traffic from AI sources
```

### Your GEO Score (Free Level)

```
Score Range:
├── 80+ = Excellent (AI will cite you)
├── 70-79 = Good (may get cited)
├── 60-69 = Okay (needs improvement)
├── <60 = Weak (less likely to be cited)

Free users see: Overall score only
Paid users see: 8-metric breakdown
```

### Basic GEO Tips (Free)

```
✅ Start with a direct answer
   "The best time to post on Instagram is..."

✅ Use bullet points and lists
   Easier for AI to parse

✅ Include at least one statistic
   "According to [source], 73% of..."

✅ Add a FAQ section
   Q&A format is AI-friendly

✅ Keep paragraphs short
   3-4 sentences max
```
